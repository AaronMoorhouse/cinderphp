<h3>Abyss Watchers</h3>
<p>
    The Abyss Watchers were the main component of the Undead Legion of Farron, a special fighting force formed 
    to combat the threat of the Abyss. Taking inspiration from the Wolf Knight (Sir Artorias, the Abyss Walker), 
    the Abyss Watchers themselves sought to utilize the techniques of Artorias, and partook of wolf blood to do so. 
    Now equipped with the strength of Artorias, they became intensely strong and agile, fighting in a coordinated 
    and sporadic pack akin to wolves.

    Though they meant the highest good, they were somewhat radical in practice. If there was even a slight threat 
    of the Abyss, the Watchers would go so far as to raze a country to the ground. Their distinct outfits, topped 
    off with a tall pointed helm, became an ill omen for any who saw them. Their wolf blood fighting style was enhanced 
    by the revolutionary use of an ultra greatsword modeled after Artorias' sword along with a crooked dagger, utilizing 
    the dagger as a fulcrum for them to develop their own unique, wild flipping and scrambling maneuvers that were even 
    more unpredictable and vicious than their predecessor. As such, they disdained the use of shields and preferred a 
    constant offense, and Hawkwood eventually deserted the Legion in part because of the mockery he received for his 
    shield.
